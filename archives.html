        <h1>the archives are under construction</h1>
        <p>my vision for archives is to have it be a conglomeration of sketchbook drawings and little snippets of writing (some of which would also be pulled from my sketchbook)</br> </br>

        it would theoretically look like a huge collage of doodles, plans, musings, and other whatnottery (like hiding some one-off fun pages that experiment with code and different aesthetics) </br> </br>
    
        however, i was emotionally unprepared to attempt scanning my sketchbook pages––the few of them that exist</p>
